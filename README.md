# Spectral_Energy_Density_of_Inflationary_Gravitational_Waves
This repository contains the Python code and associated external data to plot the spectral energy density of first-order inflationary gravitational waves (GWs). The user has the freedom to decide on the number of epochs existed during reheating (assuming sharp transitions), their equation of state and duration.

It is recommended that the whole set of files in this repository be downloaded to the same folder in order to use the code. Open the Python code, and install the associated Python packages if they are not already installed in your environment. The necessary insturctions when you give your inputs are provided in the code.

The Python script will plot the spectral energy of primordial first-order GWs and save the plot in the working directory. The code will also print the input details along with whether the reheating scenario the user have provided will satsify the BBN and aLIGO constraints.

This code is associated with the paper arXiv.2407.07956 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07956).
