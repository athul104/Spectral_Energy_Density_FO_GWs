# Spectral_Energy_Density_of_Inflationary_Gravitational_Waves
This repository contains the Python code and associated external data to plot the spectral energy density of first-order inflationary gravitational waves (GWs). The user has the freedom to decide on the number of epochs existed during reheating (assuming sharp transitions), their equation of state and duration. The plot also contains the sensitivity curves of various GW detectors. 

It is recommended that the whole set of files in this repository be downloaded to a preferred folder in order to use the code. You will need the folder path later on to run the code. Open the Python code, and install the associated Python packages if they are not already installed in your environment. Follow the instructions given in the code to run it.

This code is associated with the paper arXiv.2407.07956 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07956).
