# Energy_density_spectrum_FOGWs
This repository contains the \texttt{Python} code and associated external data to plot the energy density spectrum of first-order inflationary gravitational waves (GWs). The user have the freedom to decide on the number of epochs existed during reheating, their equation of state and duration. The plot also contains the sensitivity curves of various GW detectors. 

It is recommended that the whole set of files in this repository be downloaded to a preferred folder in order to use the code. You will need this folder path later on to run the code. Open the python code, and install the associated python packages if they are not already installed. Follow the instructions given in the code to run it.
